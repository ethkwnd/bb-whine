This code initializes a MediaRecorder object, sets up the audio source, output format, and encoder, and starts/stops the recording when the user clicks the record button. It also handles runtime permissions for audio recording and external storage.

Now your sleek, modern Android app is ready. Build and run the app in Android Studio by clicking on the "Run" button (green triangle) in the top-right corner of the window. Make sure you have a physical device or an emulator with microphone support to test the recording feature.
